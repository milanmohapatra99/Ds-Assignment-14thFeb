    "Ans:  Race Condition:-\n",

    "    \n",
    "Thread 1:\n",
    "total = num1 + num2\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread 2:\n",
    "total = num1 - num2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "=> It is very common for the race conditions to go unnoticed during testing even after multiple tests and code reviews. But in production, there would be a lot of processes and threads working parallelly \n",
    "and compete for the same resources, and this problem would occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dead Lock :-\n",
    "\n",
    "=> When two processes are waiting for each other directly or indirectly, it is called deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> This usually occurs when two processes are waiting for shared resources acquired by others. \n",
    "\n",
    "example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "If thread T1 acquired resource R1 and it also needs resource R2 for it to accomplish its task.\n",
    "But the resource R2 is acquired by thread T2 which is waiting for resource R1(which is acquired by T1).. \n",
    "Neither of them will be able to accomplish its task, as they keep waiting for the other resources they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: \n",
    "    \n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions can be difficult to detect and diagnose, as they can depend on a variety of external factors and may not be easily reproducible. To avoid these issues, it is important to design multithreaded programs carefully, with appropriate synchronization and coordination between threads to avoid conflicts and ensure correct behavior."
